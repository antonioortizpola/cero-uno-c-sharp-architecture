# About the books
- **Clean code** and **clean architecture** are two great sources to create elegant code. Clean code is a little old
(but it has a new edition with some notes about actual times), while architecture has less time published.
His books and his [blog](https://blog.cleancoder.com/) are two very valuable sources of experience.

- **The pragmmatic programmer** talks about the principles that a developer should have and some advices about how to be a great developer,
from some technical to some social advices, while the book is old, the material inside has not change with the time (we are still humans)

- **The mythical man-month** also tals about some principles, but more focused on teams and the programing control inside an organization

For architects these are very good starting points, the other books are a little more specific, but if you have some doubt,
i will do my best to help.

# About the youtube channels
- You can not go wrong with [Kevlin Henney](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kevlin+henney), some of my preferred presentations
are in the slides, but is a very good spoke person and have a very interesting things to say.

- [Venkat Subramaniam](https://agiledeveloper.com/) is also a very good developer, usually speaks using Java or some other JVM technologies,
but it is very explicative and funny to watch.

You can also refer to some other channels like
- [Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBVCTuk6uJrN3iFV_3vurg) Very good conferences
- [Microsoft visual studio](https://www.youtube.com/user/VisualStudio) Official microsoft channel, good quality videos

And search, there are gitter channels, slack, stackoverflow, github repos... we are in the communications and information era, lets take
advantage and stand on the shoulders of giants.
